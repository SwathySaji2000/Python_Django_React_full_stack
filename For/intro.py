 
# ===============================


# for is quantity based.

#  range(start,stop) - returns sequence of numbers.

#  range(start,stop,step)  ====> if it includes 3 numbers (10,20,2)

# range(1,10) => returns 1 to 9 { stop - 1 }

# range(10) => returns 1 to 9 { 10 is stop value}

#  range => iterable object 

# The  for loop is used to iterate over a sequence is called Iterable object

# it doesn't returns direct value so using a variable it calls the range

for i in range(1,10):

    print(i)

# in is a operator called membership operators are in and not in


#str type can't use range use variable
