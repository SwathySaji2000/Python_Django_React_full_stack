#### Advantage of OOPS: 

#   inheritance

#  polymorphisim


#  Abstraction



########## Inheritance is the property of inheriting one class from another class


# # we can inherit methods from parent class. 

# # # mainly used in django.

# # class Parent: 

# #     def car(self,name):

# #         self.name = name


# #     def display(self):

# # #         print(self.name)    


# # # class Child(Parent):
# # #     pass````````

# # # obj = Parent()
# # # obj.car(name="verna")
# # # obj.display()

# # # Single Inheritance

# # # Multiple  inheritance

# # # a Class which acquires / inherits  more than one class. 


# # class A:

# #     def method1():
# #         print("Heyy")

# # class B:

# #     def method2():

# #         print("Hello")


# # class C(B,A):
   #   pass



# # Multilevel   Inheritance :  
             
# # A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.

# class A:

#     def method1():

#         print("hey")

# class B(A):

#     def method2():
#         print("helloy")

# class C(B):

#     def method3():

#         print("welcomeee")


# obj = C()

# obj.method3()
# obj.method1()
# obj.method2()
