#comparision operators are  used to compare two values.

# comparision operators mostly used in conditional statements.

print(1 < True)   # 1 < 1

print(1 > False) # 1 > 1

print(1 == True)  # 1 == 1

#we can use comparision operators in numbers and char or string

#we can use the ascii code for str 
print("ab" < "ac") #means 'a' is common and b & C values of ascii code evaluates which is greater


#concatenation combing the words 
print("Hello" + "World")

print(1 + 2)
#print("hello" * "hello")  doen't support for combing two string types
#support  some arithmetic operators [!floor division]

print("hello" * 3)


print(True < False)
